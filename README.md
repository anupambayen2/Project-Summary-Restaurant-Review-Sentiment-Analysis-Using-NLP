Project Summary: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and predict whether a restaurant review is positive or negative. It is part of my daily machine learning practice uploads on GitHub.

📌 Objective

To build a text classification model that understands customer sentiment from written reviews.

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv

Contains customer reviews in text format

Target variable:

Liked (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)

This dataset is ideal for demonstrating text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.

🛠️ Steps Performed

Loaded and cleaned raw text data

Applied NLP preprocessing:

Text cleaning

Lowercasing

Stopword removal

Stemming

Converted text into numerical features using Bag of Words

Trained a machine learning classifier

Predicted sentiment on test reviews

Evaluated model using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy Score

📈 Key Insight

Proper text preprocessing significantly improves model performance.

Bag of Words effectively represents text for basic sentiment analysis.

The model correctly classifies most positive and negative reviews.

🧪 Outputs
